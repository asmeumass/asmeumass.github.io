# Our Mission
## The mission of our student chapter is to help bridge the gap between the academic classroom and a career in mechanical engineering. Through extracurricular activities, student members will be able to build and apply their engineering skills, as well as see how they can integrate these skills into a professional setting.  


# The Structure of our Club

### General body meetings

- Monthly meetings which generally consist of technical workshops, guest speakers, tours of on campus labs and facilities, and more
