### Thanks to all who attended our October event, the ASME Manufacturing and Lab Tour!

During the tour our executive board members took a group of 20 students through MIE Innovation Shop (Machine Shop), Dr. Meghan Huberâ€™s Human Robot Systems (HRS) Laboratory, the UMass All-Campus Makerspace, heard from Dr. Govind Srimathveeravalli regarding the Human Element Lab, and Dr. Gina Olson regarding her research into Soft and Compliant Robotics.  

We received feedback that the tour gave students insight into the facilities that are available to them on campus, and students were able to connect with professors about on campus research oportunities.
